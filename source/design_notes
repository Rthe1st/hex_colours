Consider having a "player" who sites on edges
Moves with edge as click hex rotates
Has to get to places on the board (say to pick stuff up)
Limited number of moves?
Could be done with just edges and not-edges
colours could bring a "hue" style feature, only move on edges of your colour
Could the things you pick up change your colour?

Probabal goal:
Collect all "characters" of the same colours into the same spot
//possible option for different coloured chracters to be combined?
